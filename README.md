### WHO AM I?

 My name is [Joseph Jo. Borras](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joborras/ "My LinkedIn profile."). I live in Oak Park, IL ("the Frank Lloyd Wright" neighborhood) with my kids, **my** cat, my wife, and **her** dog.

### WHAT IS MY BACKGROUND?

  I've spent more than twenty years in and around motorsports, mostly on the EFI and tuning side but more recently on the business side. When I got married I made the move into the dealership world, seeing that as a more stable option with less travel. Now, I'm looking for something more "adult".

### WHAT ARE YOUR CAREER GOALS?

  I'm still trying to figure that out, but I love sales and learning about different ways to look at and solve business problems, so I'm hoping I'll be able to bring those interests into the emerging FinTech market(s) in a way that gives me a unique point of view and, ultimately, advances my career.

### WHY DID YOU CHOOSE FINTECH AS A CAREER PATH?

  I'm old, so I had an "analog" childhood and witnessed the birth of the internet and the proliferation of personal and mobile computing firsthand. The emergence of blockchain has a very similar feel to me. It feels like 1997/98 internet. Post-Compuserve/AOL but still pre-Google. I feel like we're in the "Netscape" phase of a blockchain revolution, and I want to get on this train *now*.

WHO AM I?
  My name is Joseph (Jo.) Borras. I live in Oak Park, IL with my kids, my cat, my wife, and her dog.
WHAT IS MY BACKGROUND?
  I've spent more than twenty years in and around motorsports, mostly on the EFI and tuning side but more recently on the business side. When I got married I made the move into the dealership world, seeing that as a more stable option with less travel. Now, I'm looking for something more.
WHAT ARE YOUR CAREER GOALS?
  I'm still trying to figure that out, but I love sales and learning about different ways to look at and solve business problems, so I'm hoping I'll be able to bring those interests into the emerging FinTech market(s) in a way that makes sense and advances my career.
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE FINTECH AS A CAREER PATH?
  I'm old, so I had an "analog" childhood and witnessed the birth of the internet and the proliferation of personal and mobile computing firsthand. The emergence of blockchain has a very similar feel to me. It feels like 1997/98 internet. Post Compuserve/AOL but still pre-Google. I feel like we're in the "Netscape" phase, and I want to get on this train now.

### Unit 14 HW Summary
<hr />
<p align="justify">This homework had us building two predictive models, one using the crypto "fear and greed" (fng) index, and the other using closing price history.  As you will see when going through the HW, it went fairly smoothly, with the final plots showing the relative merits of each approach located at the "bottom" of each notebook.
